# Reti Logiche Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the Logic Networks course at Politecnico di Milano. The project implements a digital component in VHDL as described in the project specifications. The repository includes the VHDL source code, testbenches, and project documentation.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project was to synthesize a digital component that exhibits the behavior described in the requirements. The design is implemented in VHDL and tested using Vivado.

---

## Project Structure

- `MemoryChannel/src/`: Contains the VHDL source code for the main component.
- `MemoryChannel/test/`: Contains the testbench files used for simulation.
- `Deliverables/`: Contains the project requirements and documentation.

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Open Vivado and create a new project.
2. Add the VHDL files from the `MemoryChannel/src/` folder as design sources.
3. Add the testbench files from the `MemoryChannel/test/` folder as simulation sources.
4. Run the simulation to verify the component's behavior.
